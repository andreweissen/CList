### CList ###

__CList__ is a fairly boring implementation of a standard [linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) written in [ANSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C) [C17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C17_(C_standard_revision))-compliant [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)). Inspired by the default [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) array data structure, the list module contains functions permitting its use as a standard list, [stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)), or [queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) depending on use case. It also has "bonus" functions permitting the removal or addition of nodes at specific indices in relation to the head node, the removal of nodes by their associated values, or the reversal of the list structure.

CList was developed by the author as a means of familiarizing himself with the formatting conventions of the C language. As such, it is not the most optimized or bug-free implementation of a linked list in C to be found on the Internet; however, it is an original implementation, as the author intentionally developed it by hand without looking at any other generic C language list implementations or guides.
